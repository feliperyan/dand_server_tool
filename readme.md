# D&D DM Remote Server Tool 🧙
## Golang Websocket server app. Easily deployable on Heroku or Google App Engine Flexible via Docker.

> 🚨This project was a fun way for me to get more comfortable with Golang and most of all to grok Go routines and channels. It's very much in the _make it work_ phase 🍝 of the "make it work -> make it right -> make it fast" concept.

### Please refer [this repo](https://github.com/feliperyan/dand_client_tool) for the companion client app.

### Server address
Once you get the server up and running give the address to the players, minus any protocol prefixes (so don't add http or https). For example if you deploy this to Heroku and you get ```https://my-awesome-server.herokuapp.com``` give the players only this portion: ```my-awesome-server.herokuapp.com```.

Trying to push to GCP......
